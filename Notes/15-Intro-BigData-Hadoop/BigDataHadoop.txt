Course Objective
	Introduct the BigData and Hadooo Theory, empowering us to undestand these two concepts and how they
	can be apply.
Data cenary nowadays:
	Nowadays we have data being generated all the time, the quantity of generated data is growing even more, and these
	data have a large range of datatypes.
	
	The IDC (International Data Corporation) predicts that in 2025 we'll hae 175 zettabytes of information.

	Many of the data generated are created automatic, in Iot components, GPS, photos, videos etc.

Estructure and Data Processing
	Almost 90% of all the existing data, were generated in the last 4 years and the greater piece of these data are non-structured data.
	
	The Data can be defined in 3 diffent structures:
		- Structured
		- Semi-Structured
		- Non-Structured
	
	Structured Data: Are the data that has well defined structures, rigid, that was previously planned to save them. For an example: Databases, 
		Execel, delimited file, positional file.

	Semi-Structured: 
		Doesn't have totally defined/rigid structure and neither flexible, being a heterogeneous representation between structured and non structured.
		For an example: JSON, XML.
