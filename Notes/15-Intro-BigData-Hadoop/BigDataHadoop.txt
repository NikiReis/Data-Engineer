Course Objective
	Introduct the BigData and Hadooo Theory, empowering us to undestand these two concepts and how they
	can be apply.
Data cenary nowadays:
	Nowadays we have data being generated all the time, the quantity of generated data is growing even more, and these
	data have a large range of datatypes.
	
	The IDC (International Data Corporation) predicts that in 2025 we'll hae 175 zettabytes of information.

	Many of the data generated are created automatic, in Iot components, GPS, photos, videos etc.

Estructure and Data Processing
	Almost 90% of all the existing data, were generated in the last 4 years and the greater piece of these data are non-structured data.
	
	The Data can be defined in 3 diffent structures:
		- Structured
		- Semi-Structured
		- Non-Structured
	
	Structured Data: Are the data that has well defined structures, rigid, that was previously planned to save them. For an example: Databases, 
		Execel, delimited file, positional file.

	Semi-Structured: 
		Doesn't have totally defined/rigid structure and neither flexible, being a heterogeneous representation between structured and non structured.
		For an example: JSON, XML.  

BigData Definition:
	BigData is a concept, that defines handle with a large mass of data through specialize tools, that permits the informations to be found, analysed
	and utilized in habil time.

	The BigData in his concept has the challenge of provides the 4Vs 
		Volume
		Velocity
		Variety
		Veracity
	
	Data Warehouse and DataLake are two concepts of data storing, one came from BI and the other BigData.
	DataWarehouse - BI
	DataLake - BigData
