Random Library
	This library implements pseudorandom number generetors to a vast distributions.
	This library will be used in the password generator to randomize the letters and numbers 
		and each runtime will generate a new random password.
	
	*Authentication and Confidentiality Principles*

Hash Library
	The hash is like a unique identifier, generated by an algorith that will analyse byte per byte a determinated data
		to generate by a unique form a determinated code that only that file will have. If in this file a unique bit
		git changed the hash generated will be diferent.
		We'll use md5 as encryptation algorithm.
	*Integrity Principle*
	
	haslib:
		This library implements a comon interface for many secure hash agorithms as SHA1, SHA256, MD5 and others
		We'll use this library em our hash caparer to compare two files.

Multithreading 
	Thread is a process and in the multithread field each process can asigned to a lor of concurrent solicitations or even simultaneous. 
	Threading Library:
		This library build a high level interface to processing, using the thred module, a lowest level, that means direct relation to the processor.

IPaddress Library:
	This library has the capacity of create, manipulate IP addresses from IPv4 and IPv6 and even entire networks.

Hashlib Library:
	Implements an interface for many secure hashs algorithms such like SHA1, SHA256, MD5 and others.
