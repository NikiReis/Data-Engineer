Introduction to Socket Library and TCP/UDP Client

	Socket Library:
		Python's library. This library provides access to a low level network interface. The OS provides an API socket that relates the program to the network.

	*In this module we'll build a TCP and UDP client and also a serve to make possible that these two clients connect to the server using the socket library*

	TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is one of the comunication protocols, that gives suport to the global internet, verifing if the datas are sent in the correct
		frequency without errors. Our program is going to verify if the datas are being sent in way to keep the integrity. 
			*Integrity Principle*

	UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a simple user datagram protocol from the transport layer that permits that the application sent a datagram inside a package IPv4 or IPv6
		to a destiny, tought without any gratee that the package will be received correctly.
			*Disponibility Principle*
